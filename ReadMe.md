## How to Compile
  - Download network.java, receiver.java, sender.java, and Packets.java
  - Switch into the directory that contains all these files
  - Enter the command javac *.java to compile all the files
  - Prior to running the code you will need to create a test text file in the same directory. Let's assume you've named this file __message.txt__

## Running the Code

  - On thunder.cise.ufl.edu: java network [Port Number]
  - On sand.cise.ufl.edu: java receiver thunder.cise.ufl.edu [Same Port Number]
  - On storm.cise.ufl.edu: java sender thunder.cise.ufl.edu [Same Port Number] [Whatever you named the test file]
